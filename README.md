# CodeBasicsResumeChallenge6_CodeXMarketAnalysis
CodeX is a German beverage company that is aiming to make its mark in the Indian market. ï»¿
A few months ago, they launched their energy drink in 10 cities of India.
Their Marketing team is responsible for increasing brand awareness, market share, and product development. 
They conducted a survey in those 10 cities and received results from 10k respondents. 
As a marketing data analyst I am trying to convert these survey results to meaningful insights which the team can use to drive actions.
